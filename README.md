## End Of Life

On 18 December 2025 (Thursday), velocity-eagler will **no** longer recieve **any** updates. This is mainly beacause velocity-eagler is incredibily insecure, after 18 December 2025 (Thursday) your current Web Services will still be online. I recommended you switching to velocity-javaxeagler, which is not only more secure but has more QoL features. If you still want to use velocity-eagler (for whatever reason) you can find it [here](./guide.md).

Starting 10 January 2026 (Friday) velocity-eagler will be archived.
